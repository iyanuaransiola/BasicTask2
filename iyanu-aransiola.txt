Question A: EXPLAIN THE BASIC RULES OF CSS SPECIFICITY

One of the fundamental concepts of CSS is specificity and it entails how CSS is applied to HTML. It also determines which style declarations are ultimately applied to an element
This applies when the same element is targeted by multiple declarations, causing conflict of interest, hence  is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. 
Specificity is based on the matching rules which are composed of different sorts of CSS selectors.
Specificity is a weight that is applied to a given CSS declaration, determined by the number of each selector type in the matching selector.

Some basic rules of css specificity include the following: 

(i) ID selectors have a higher specificity than attribute selectors.

(ii)Contextual selectors are more specific than a single element selector - The embedded style sheet is closer to the element to be styled. 

(iii) A class selector beats any number of element selectors - a class selector such as .intro beats h1, p, div, etc. An element selector is less specific.

(iv) When multiple declarations have equal specificity, the last declaration found in the CSS is applied to the element. 

(v) Sort the declarations by the source and the type of style sheet. The source specifies the origin from where the styles are rendered.

(vi) Highest priority is dedicated to the external style sheet defined by an author, in cascading order of priority is the reader, and the last is the browser.

(vii) Universal selector (*), combinators (+, >, ~, ' ', ||) and negation pseudo-class (:not()) have no effect on specificity. 

(viii) Inline styles added to an element (e.g., style="font-weight: bold;") always overwrite any styles in external stylesheets, and thus can be thought of as having the highest specificity.




				Question B: EXPLAIN THE THREE MAIN WAYS TO APPLY CSS TO A WEB PAGE

There are three ways one can use to implement CSS mainly: internal/embedded, external/link, and inline styles.

(1) Internal or embedded CSS requires you to add <style> tag in the <head> section of your HTML document:

This CSS style is an effective method of styling a single page. However, using this style for multiple pages is time-consuming as one need to put CSS rules to every page of one's website.

Here’s how you can use internal CSS:

					Open your HTML page and locate <head> opening tag.
					Put the following code right after the <head> tag
					<style type="text/css">
					Add CSS rules on a new line. Here’s an example:


Internal style sheet type allows the use class and ID selectors in this style sheet.

(2) External/Link CSS is the medium through which one links the web pages to an external .css file.
This CSS type is a more efficient method, especially for styling a large website. By editing one .css file, one can change one's entire site at once.
Since the CSS code is in a separate document, one's HTML files will have a cleaner structure and will also be smaller in size.
You can use the same .css file for multiple pages.
      Here is an examplary steps to use external CSS:

Create a new .css file, and add the style rules. For example:

					.xleftcol {
   					float: left;
   					width: 33%;
   					background:#809900;
					}

Next: In the <head> section of the HTML sheet, add a reference to the external .css file right after <title> tag:
					<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style.css" />

(3) Inline CSS
Inline CSS is used to style a specific HTML element. For this CSS style, one will only need to add the style attribute to each HTML tag, without using selectors.

This CSS type is not really recommended, as each HTML tag needs to be styled individually. Managing one’s website may become too hard and cumbersome if one only use inline CSS. Here is an instance of Inline style:
Here, we add an inline CSS to the <p> and <h1> tag:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body style="background-color:black;">
<h1 style="color:white;padding:30px;">Hostinger Tutorials</h1>
<p style="color:white;">Something usefull here.</p>
</body>
</html>


****Summarily, Internal or embedded ?— add <style> tag in the <head> section of HTML document
      External ?— link the HTML sheet to a separate .css file
        	      Inline ?— apply CSS rules for specific elements.
CSS can be applied to HTML or XHTML using three methods: linked/external, embedded/Internal, and inline. 
In the linked method, the CSS is stored in a separate file, instead of directly in the HTML page. 
In the embedded method, CSS is stored as part of the HTML page, in the header section. In the inline method, CSS is stored directly in the style attributes of the HTML tags, as <div style="font-weight:bold">Bold Font</div>.




		Question C: EXPLAIN THE THREE MAIN WAYS TO TARGET ELEMENTS

In CSS, selectors are used to target the HTML elements on our web pages that we want to style.
 A CSS selector is the first part of a CSS Rule. It is a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the CSS property values inside the rule applied to them. 
The element or elements which are selected by the selector are referred to as the subject of the selector.

One of the way is the selectors that target an HTML element such as an <h1>. 
hence we'll get h1 { } for the css syntax incorporation.

2.It also includes selectors which target a class: .box { }

3. or, an ID slector such as this: #unique { }
